;=================
; Grass types
;=================

; allows probability to add a mesh. The algorithm is:
; - generates a random number between 0 and 100
; - if the random number is greater than the sum of chances seen so far, pick that mesh. Otherwise
;   move to the next mesh
; - if no mesh is found it generates an object "UNKNOWN_GRASS"
;
; Note:
; - For an unknown reason the sum of chances seen starts at 1 and not 0. This means that the first mesh has
;   and additional 1% chance of being placed
; - There is no validation that the chances defined in the file sum to 99 (taking into account the 1% above).
;   chances over 99 will be ignored.
